# Capstone-Project
# NYC PAYROLL DATA INTEGRATION
# Project Introduction
The City of New York is embarking on a project to integrate payroll data across all its
agencies. The City of New York would like to develop a Data Analytics platform to
accomplish two primary objectives:

• Financial Resource Allocation Analysis: Analyze how the City's financial resources are
allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.

• Transparency and Public Accessibility: Make the data available to the interested public
to show how the City’s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all
municipal employees.


# OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
Design a Data Warehouse for NYC
• Develop a scalable and automated ETL Pipeline to load the payroll data NYC data
warehouse
• Develop aggregate table(s) in the Data warehouse for easy analysis of the key business
questions
• Ensure quality and consistency of data in your pipeline
• Create a public user with limited privileges to enable public access to the NYC Data
warehouse

# TO DO'S
• Properly document all processes for reproducibility – version control

• Maintain a cloud hosted repository of your codebase to facilitate collaboration with
team members

# IMPORTANT NOTES
The project team
also includes the city’s quality assurance experts who will test the pipelines to find any
errors and improve overall data quality.

The source data resides in a remote folder and needs to be processed in a NYC data
warehouse. The source datasets consist of CSV files with Employee master data and
monthly payroll data entered by various City Agencies.
